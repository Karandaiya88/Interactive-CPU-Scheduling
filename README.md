# Interactive-CPU-Scheduling
An interactive simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms that visualizes how different scheduling strategies like FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin manage processes. Ideal for learning, experimentation, and understanding process scheduling in operating systems through hands-onÂ simulation.
